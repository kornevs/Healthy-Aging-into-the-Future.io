            <p>The project's aim is to promote health and participation in daily activities for older adults at risk of frailty in order to increase quality of life and delay the need for home care. The project will develop and evaluate the effects of a technological infrastructure that enables a new organizational model for primary care, focusing on the prevention and improvement of frailty involving two relevant stakeholders: older adults and medical staff within primary care.</p> 
<p>The research question is: <i>Can a multimodal preventive intervention, i.e., ACTIVE@HOME supported by a technical support system, maintain or improve the physical performance, cognitive functions, mood, independence in daily life, participation in engaging daily activities, quality of life, and reduce the number of falls for older adults?</i></p>
<p>A multimodal digi-physical prevention program based on a combination of physical group meetings and supportive welfare technology will be used to prevent and treat frailty. A home monitoring platform and a communication system between the older person, family members, and primary care staff will facilitate communication, support, and preventive measures. The physical meetings will be based on previous studies within the research group and will be guided together with staff from primary care.</p>
<p>The idea of the monitoring platform and communication system is based on a tested system called POSITIVE, with the ability to support older adults with frailty who still live at home without home care, or who are at risk of developing frailty, to maintain their abilities when facing declines in inherent capacity. By participating in a group-based preventive program, medical interventions at the right time, and an online physical training program, older adults may potentially improve their well-being and quality of life, reduce the incidence of falls, injuries, and hospitalizations, and increase the sense of security in daily life. The expected outcome is that the older adults will have reduced or maintained stable frailty, increased performance and satisfaction in doing daily activities, a higher level of self-efficacy, and quality of life, which will delay the need for formal care.</p>

			<h3>Study design and research setting</h3>
			<p>Based on our previous studies, the multimodal preventive intervention to prevent frailty in older adults, supported by a technical system, will be adapted, implemented, and evaluated/tested with frail older adults living at home. The project will be linked to an academic primary care center in Stockholm, Sweden. The project consists of several studies, first to develop the intervention program in close collaboration with participatory methods involving stakeholders, i.e., frail older adults, primary care staff, and leaders). A prototype will be tested by 10 frail older adults in close collaboration with the primary care center. In the next phase, ACTIVE@HOME will be evaluated in a pilot study with a pragmatic, randomized, waitlist-controlled study design with blinded outcome assessment to study the feasibility of the design and methods to evaluate the effects. To develop knowledge about implementation, how and when to use and integrate preventive interventions, qualitative studies will be conducted during and after the pilot in an urban area in Sweden. Furthermore, an evaluation of the clinical and cost-effectiveness at the group level will be carried out.</p>

			<h3>Intervention and implementation of the program</h3>
			<p>The intervention group (n=20) will receive a medical review, nutritional recommendations, and an exercise program, including five supportive 90-minute group sessions to promote participation in engaging daily activities delivered from the primary care center by an interprofessional team (nurse, dietitian, occupational therapist, and physiotherapist). The intervention group will also receive a mobile or web application as part of the technical system with measurement tools for physical tests performed at home. A nurse at the primary care center will then follow the participants in the intervention group for a six-month period using a digital remote system and, if necessary, provide support to the older adults with messages within the system. The waitlist controls (n=20) will receive the same treatment after 6 months as a control. The implementation will be monitored through reflective diaries (to be filled in by the staff), data from the monitoring system, and based on interviews with the participants.</p>

			<h3>Methods of data collection and analysis</h3>
			<p>Qualitative and quantitative methods, along with a process evaluation of the usability, acceptability, and adherence to the proposed technical system, will be used. The physical exercise program will be followed through registration in the system and with qualitative interviews with older adults, their family members, and staff from the primary care center. The intended outcomes are the optimization of perceived participation in engaging daily activities to maintain or reduce frailty in older adults. Pre- and post-testing of primary outcomes (frailty) and secondary outcomes (function and participation in ADL, confidence, life satisfaction, contacts with primary care, costs) will be conducted before and after the intervention implementation. Web-based applications such as Red-cap will be used to collect data. The goal is to evaluate the design, recruitment, methods, and procedures to plan for a full-scale RCT. The overall results of the project will be a preventive model that facilitates a person-centered, effective, and relevant prevention of frailty and knowledge of implementation strategies needed in different settings.</p>
