            <p>The purpose of this project is to continue developing, implement, and evaluate a unique rehabilitation service, ASSIST 2.0. ASSIST 2.0 is designed based on the research group's knowledge of rehabilitation, including a feasibility study that tested ASSIST 1.0.</p>
<p>The research question is: <i>Can older adults receiving ASSIST 2.0 improve their performance and satisfaction in daily life activities, experience a higher level of self-confidence, perceived health, and quality of life?</i></p>
<p>The project will determine the differences in the rehabilitation service (ASSIST 2.0) compared to regular home care in terms of older adults' performance in daily activities, self-confidence, perceived health, and quality of life. ASSIST integrates education and support from healthcare professionals to home care staff and uses technological solutions to facilitate communication between all stakeholders. In the ASSIST 2.0 intervention, older adults will identify problems in performing necessary and desired daily activities. Home care staff, under the guidance of healthcare professionals, will support older adults in performing these activities. Home care staff will receive training and supervision from professionals to ensure adherence to the rehabilitation method.</p>

			<<p>The project includes an evaluation of the effects of ASSIST 2.0 compared to regular home care. A cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) with recruitment through two home care units in Stockholm and two home care units in Uppsala, randomized to an intervention group (IG) receiving ASSIST 2.0 or to a control group (CG) receiving regular home care. The ASSIST 2.0 program involves care staff (nurses, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists) working at the intervention units who will be responsible for training and supervising the home care staff. Care staff working with ASSIST (IG) will participate in a training program provided by the researchers through various workshops.</p>

			<h3>Intervention and implementation of the program</h3>
			<p>The ASSIST 2.0 rehabilitation program consists of the following components: a) an intervention aimed at older adults to help them perform the daily activities they need and want to do. This will be achieved through optimal support from home care staff, b) training for care staff in the art and science of reablement provided by the researchers, c) training and support through mentorship and coaching provided by care staff for home care staff to ensure the proper delivery of reablement, and d) support for communication between older adults, their relatives, home care staff, and healthcare professionals, through the integration of QR codes in the service.</p>

			<p>To study the effects of ASSIST 2.0 in the IG compared to a CG, 90<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> older adults living at home and in need of home care, and their possible relatives, will be recruited. Quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to evaluate the intervention. Standardized instruments will be used to assess the older adults' a) perceived performance and satisfaction in daily life activities, b) independence in activities of daily living (ADL), c) amount of sedentary behavior, d) self-efficacy, and e) overall quality of life. For the significant others, a) caregiver burden and b) provision of informal care will be assessed. For both older adults and relatives, a) perceived life satisfaction and b) levels of anxiety and depression will be assessed. The experiences of the intervention will be explored through qualitative interviews with the participating older adults, their relatives, healthcare professionals, and home care staff.</p>

      <p class="text-xs">1. An effect calculation is based on our feasibility study. The outcome measure Canadian Occupational Performance Measure showed that for a 95% chance of demonstrating a real treatment effect (95% power), 45 older adults will be included in each group, with a calculation for dropouts.</p>
