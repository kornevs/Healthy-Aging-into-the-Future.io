Age-related illnesses create a challenge for individuals, families as well as for social, economic and health care systems. Frailty is a health condition that is defined as a progressive age-related decline that results in reduced reserves of own capacity. Resources in health care need to be concentrated on the older care recipients, a population that is growing in Sweden.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The project aims to enhance and assess a distinctive reablement service called ASSIST 2.0, building upon previous research and feasibility studies. ASSIST 2.0 incorporates insights from reablement research and utilizes technology to improve communication among stakeholders. It involves older adults identifying challenges in daily activities, with homecare staff receiving guidance and education from healthcare professionals to support them. The project will compare ASSIST 2.0 with standard homecare, evaluating its impact on older adults' performance in daily activities, self-efficacy, perceived health, and quality of life. It adheres to evaluation guidelines set by the Medical Research Council and the CONSORT statement for non-pharmacological trials. The central research question is whether older adults receiving ASSIST 2.0 can experience enhanced performance, satisfaction, self-efficacy, perceived health, and quality of life.</p>

Music-based interventions have shown promise in influencing various aspects of health and well-being, including cognition and emotional states, but there is a need to bridge analog interventions with technology to create scalable solutions. This project aims to address this gap by exploring how different technologies can be effectively used to improve outcomes for older adults with frailty and dementia. Additionally, the project emphasizes the importance of involving end-users in the development and implementation of these technologies to ensure their suitability and effectiveness in daily life.</br> <b>Purpose of the Project </b></br> The project aims to investigate the potential benefits of technology-based interventions for older adults with frailty, including dementia, and their caregivers. Examples of technology-based interventions include: <ul> <li>Online music programs </li> <li>Digital apps </li> <li>Virtual reality </li></ul> <b>Music-Based Interventions and Their Potential </b></br> Music-based interventions have shown promising results in several areas, such as: <ul> <li>Improved cognition</li> <li>Positive emotional states</li> <li>Overall increased well-being</li> </ul> Despite these successes, there is a need to integrate these analog methods with technology to develop scalable solutions that reach more users. </br> <b>User-Centered Development </b></br> A central part of the project is to involve the end-users – both older adults and their caregivers – in the development and implementation of the technical solutions. This ensures that the technologies are: </br><ul> <li>Suitable for daily use</li> <li>Effective for the target group</li> </ul></p>

Frontiers in Health Services 2022">Pérez Jolles and colleagues (2022)</span>, and on ideas behind Patient and Public Involvement (PPI), this project integrates collaborative methods and partnerships to engage stakeholders, including older adults, carers, health professionals, and public policy and management representatives, in designing and refining interventions. By leveraging different types of co-creation methods, the project aims to enhance user experience and improving conditions for implementing the study protocol. It adopts a cascading framework for design, modelling, and production to facilitate engagement across the projects in the research program. Given the ongoing need for understanding effective collaborative strategies in aging research, this project focuses on addressing this knowledge gap. The central research question explores how co-creation methods and PPI can optimize interventions for older adults living with frailty.</p>
