Age-related diseases are a challenge for individuals, families, and social, economic, and healthcare systems. Frailty is a health condition defined as a progressive age-related decline that results in reduced reserves of personal capacity. Resources within healthcare must be focused on older care recipients, a growing population in Sweden.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The project aims to improve and evaluate a specific reablement service called ASSIST 2.0, which builds on previous research and feasibility studies. ASSIST 2.0 draws on insights from research on prescription and uses technology to improve communication among stakeholders. It means that older adults identify challenges in daily activities, and home care staff receive guidance and training from healthcare professionals to support them. The project will compare ASSIST 2.0 with standard home care and evaluate its impact on older adults' performance in daily activities, self-efficacy, perceived health, and quality of life. The project follows the evaluation guidelines set by the Medical Research Council and the CONSORT Statement for non-pharmacological trials. The central research question is whether older adults receiving ASSIST 2.0 can experience improved performance, satisfaction, self-efficacy, perceived health, and quality of life.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The project aims to investigate how technology-based solutions, such as online music programs, digital apps, and virtual reality, can improve life for older adults with frailty, such as those with dementia, and their caregivers. Music-based interventions have already shown promising effects on various aspects of health and well-being, such as better cognition and emotional states. The next step in this research will be to combine these analog methods with more modern technology to explore how different technologies can be used effectively and purposefully.</p>
    
            <p>By investigating how different technologies can be used effectively, the goal is to improve the quality of life for older adults with frailty and dementia. An important part of the process is to involve the users themselves, both the older adults and their caregivers, in both the development and implementation of new technology-based solutions.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The project serves as a bridge between Projects A-C and integrates a critical role through stakeholder engagement in the design of interventions within healthcare as well as municipal care. The project integrates co-creation methods to engage stakeholders such as older adults, caregivers, healthcare professionals, and representatives from the public or private sectors at various levels. Co-creation involves shifting the view of knowledge to something that can be created together between experts and individuals with diverse lived experiences. Through co-creation, the project contributes to improved conditions for the implementation of study protocols and relevance for users. A framework with various types of co-creation methods and strategies is being developed to facilitate engagement. There is a need to understand effective strategies for co-creation research in aging, and one goal of the project is to fill part of this knowledge gap. The central research question is to examine how co-creation methods can optimize interventions for older adults living with frailty.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The project aims to describe the key elements and relationships within various interventions related to preventive measures, reablement, and home care. It seeks to understand how interventions based on person-centered methods affect service delivery, workload, user experience, and organizational factors. By evaluating and synthesizing data from Projects A-D, the project aims to develop an implementation model that can be applied in future primary and home care settings. The central research questions focus on identifying components and mechanisms of influence within different services and exploring strategies to facilitate change within the healthcare system and its context.</p>
